⚖️ Class Balancing Techniques Implemented

Class imbalance was handled using the following four techniques:

Random Oversampling

Increases minority class samples by duplicating existing data points.

Random Undersampling

Reduces majority class samples to balance the dataset.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

Generates synthetic data points for the minority class.

Class Weight Adjustment

Assigns higher weight to minority class during model training.

Learning:
Balancing techniques significantly improve model fairness and performance on imbalanced datasets.

📊 Data Visualization

Scatter plots were used to analyze feature relationships.

Visualizations helped validate regression assumptions.

Plots assisted in understanding class distribution before and after balancing.

🔍 Observations & Learnings

Linear Regression performs well when assumptions are satisfied.

Logistic Regression is sensitive to class imbalance.

Applying balancing techniques improves classification performance.

Visualization plays a key role in model selection and validation.

Proper evaluation metrics are critical for reliable model assessment.
